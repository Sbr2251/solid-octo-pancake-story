A robbery has just happened and a million dollars has been stolen. The thief was by himself and recruited civillians to help him with his robbery. He told 10 civillians to do one sinple task for a thousand dollars with the civillians not knowing that they were a part of a robbery. The police were bewildered. How could someone have thought of such a masterful plan. In order to catch the culprit, they would have to interrogate every civilian in the town, but that was impossible.
