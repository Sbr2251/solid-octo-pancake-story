A robbery has just happened and a million dollars has been stolen. The thief was by himself and recruited civillians to help him with his robbery. He told 10 civillians to do one sinple task for a thousand dollars with the civillians not knowing that they were a part of a robbery. The police were bewildered. How could someone have thought of such a masterful plan. In order to catch the culprit, they would have to interrogate every civilian in the town, but that was impossible. 
The police had a new idea, they decided to get the bank statements of all potentiail civilian collaborators to check their transactions and see if a deposit was made. As the police entered the Federal Reserve branch in Boston they were surrounded by 10 civillians and the original criminal. It was clear, that they wanted to double down and rob the Federal Reserve. The police were out numbered, 3 to 10. Each civillian had a gun and so did the robber. They took the police into a secure location, the reserve workers were in on the crime. The police were locked up into a large holding cell. Time passed and the criminal came into the cell to talk with the officers.
